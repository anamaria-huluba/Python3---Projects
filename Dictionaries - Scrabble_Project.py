#Dictionaries - Scrabble Project

#In this project, you will process some data from a group of friends playing scrabble. You will use dictionaries to organize players, words, and points.

letters = ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J", "K", "L", "M", "N", "O", "P", "Q", "R", "S", "T", "U", "V", "W", "X", "Y", "Z"]
points = [1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 4, 2, 4, 1, 8, 5, 1, 3, 4, 1, 3, 10, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 8, 4, 10]

Build your Point Dictionary

1. We have provided you with two lists, letters and points. We would like to combine these two into a dictionary that would map a letter to its point value.

Using a list comprehension and zip, create a dictionary called letter_to_points that has the elements of letters as the keys and the elements of points as the values.

letter_to_points = {letter: point for letter, point in zip(letters, points)} 

2. Our letters list did not take into account blank tiles. Add an element to the letter_to_points dictionary that has a key of " " and a point value of 0.

letter_to_points[" "] = 0
print(letter_to_points)

#returns: {'A': 1, 'B': 3, 'C': 3, 'D': 2, 'E': 1, 'F': 4, 'G': 2, 'H': 4, 'I': 1, 'J': 8, 'K': 5, 'L': 1, 'M': 3, 'N': 4, 'O': 1, 'P': 3, 'Q': 10, 'R': 1, 'S': 1, 'T': 1, 
'U': 1, 'V': 4, 'W': 4, 'X': 8, 'Y': 4, 'Z': 10, ' ': 0}

3. We want to create a function that will take in a word and return how many points that word is worth.
Define a function called score_word that takes in a parameter word.

4. Inside score_word, create a variable called point_total and set it to 0.

5. After defining point_total, create a for loop that goes through the letters in word and adds the point value of each letter to point_total.
You should get the point value from the letter_to_points dictionary. If the letter you are checking for is not in letter_to_points, add 0 to the point_total.

6. After the for loop is finished, return point_total.

def score_word(word):
  point_total = 0
  for letter in word:
    point_total += letter_to_points.get(letter, 0)
  return point_total
    
7. Let’s test this function! Create a variable called brownie_points and set it equal to the value returned by the score_word() function with an input of "BROWNIE".

brownie_points = score_word("BROWNIE")

8. We expect the word BROWNIE to earn 15 points:

(B + R + O + W + N + I + E)
 
(3 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1) = 15
Let’s print out brownie_points to make sure we got it right.

print(brownie_points)
#returns: 15

Score a Game
9. Create a dictionary called player_to_words that maps players to a list of the words they have played. This table represents the data to transcribe into your dictionary:

player1	wordNerd	Lexi Con	Prof Reader
BLUE	  EARTH	    ERASER	  ZAP
TENNIS	EYES	    BELLY	    COMA
EXIT	 MACHINE	  HUSKY	    PERIOD

player_to_words = {"player1": ["BLUE", "TENNIES", "EXIT"], "wordNerd": ["EARTH", "EYES", "MACHINE"], "Lexi Con": ["ERASER", "BELLY", "HUSKY"], "Prof Reader": ["ZAP", "COMA", "PERIOD"]}

10. Create an empty dictionary called player_to_points.

player_to_points = {}

11. Iterate through the items in player_to_words. Call each player player and each list of words words.

Within your loop, create a variable called player_points and set it to 0.

for player, words in player_to_words.item():
  player_points = 0

12. Within the loop, create another loop that goes through each word in words and adds the value of score_word() with word as an input.

for player, words in player_to_words.item():
  player_points = 0
  for word in words:
    player_points += score_word(word)

13. After the inner loop ends, set the current player value to be a key of player_to_points, with a value of player_points.

for player, words in player_to_words.items():
  player_points = 0
  for word in words:
    player_points += score_word(word)
  player_to_points[player] = player_points
 
 14. player_to_points should now contain the mapping of players to how many points they’ve scored. Print this out to see the current standings for this game!

If you’ve calculated correctly, wordNerd should be winning by 1 point.
print(player_to_points)
# returns: {'player1': 30, 'wordNerd': 32, 'Lexi Con': 31, 'Prof Reader': 31}, making wordNerd the winner by 1 point.

15. If you want extended practice, try to implement some of these ideas with the Python you’ve learned:

a. play_word() — a function that would take in a player and a word, and add that word to the list of words they’ve played

def play_word(player, word):
#this function takes in a player and a word, and adds that word to the list of words they've played
  player_to_words[player].append(word)
 
play_word("player1", "PYTHON")

print(player_to_words)
# returns: {'player1': ['BLUE', 'TENNIES', 'EXIT', 'PYTHON'], 'wordNerd': ['EARTH', 'EYES', 'MACHINE'], 'Lexi Con': ['ERASER', 'BELLY', 'HUSKY'], 
'Prof Reader': ['ZAP', 'COMA', 'PERIOD']}

b. update_point_totals() — turn your nested loops into a function that you can call any time a word is played

player_to_words = {}

def update_point_total():
  for player, words in player_to_words.items():
    player_points = 0
      for word in words:
        player_points += score_word(word)
      player_to_points[player] = player_points
      
update_point_total()
print(player_to_words)

c. make your letter_to_points dictionary able to handle lowercase inputs as well

letter += [letter.lower() for letter in letters]
print *= 2
